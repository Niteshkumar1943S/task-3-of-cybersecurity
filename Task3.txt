# Vulnerability Assessment and Reporting

## **Introduction**
The purpose of this task was to identify, analyze, and document security vulnerabilities present in a Windows 11 environment.  
Two different vulnerability scanning tools were used — **Nessus Essentials** (on Windows) and **OpenVAS** (on Kali Linux) — to conduct a comprehensive assessment.  
The assessment aimed to highlight misconfigurations, insecure services, and potential risks that could be exploited by attackers.

## **Tools Used**
- **Windows 11 OS** – Target operating system for vulnerability assessment  
- **Nessus Essentials** – Performed a detailed localhost scan to identify vulnerabilities  
- **Kali Linux** – Penetration testing environment used for additional scanning  
- **OpenVAS** – Open-source vulnerability scanner used for cross-validation of findings  

## **Procedure**
1. **Setup and Configuration**
   - Installed and configured **Nessus Essentials** on Windows 11  
   - Prepared **Kali Linux** environment with **OpenVAS** installed  

2. **Scanning with Nessus Essentials**
   - Launched a **localhost scan** targeting `127.0.0.1`  
   - Allowed Nessus to enumerate services, ports, and running applications  
   - Exported the final scan results as an HTML file (converted to PDF for documentation)

3. **Scanning with OpenVAS**
   - Ran authenticated and unauthenticated scans against the same host from Kali Linux  
   - Collected findings to compare with Nessus results

4. **Analysis and Documentation**
   - Reviewed all detected vulnerabilities  
   - Identified common issues between the two scanning tools  
   - Summarized key risks for reporting  

## **Key Findings (from Nessus Essentials)**

### 1. SMB Signing Not Required – **Medium Risk**
- **Description:** The SMB service does not require message signing, which allows an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks by intercepting SMB traffic  
- **Affected Port:** TCP 445  
- **Recommendation:** Enable *"Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)"* in Group Policy

### 2. SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted – **Medium Risk**
- **Description:** The SSL/TLS certificate used by the scanned service is self-signed or issued by an unknown Certificate Authority  
- **Affected Port:** TCP 8834  
- **Risk:** May allow man-in-the-middle attacks due to unverified server identity  
- **Recommendation:** Obtain and install a valid certificate from a trusted CA

### 3. Multiple RPC Services Enumeration – **Information Level**
- **Description:** Numerous Distributed Computing Environment / Remote Procedure Call (DCE/RPC) services were detected  
- **Risk:** Could provide attackers with service-specific details for targeted exploits  
- **Recommendation:** Restrict unnecessary RPC services and limit exposure to trusted networks


## **Key Findings (from OpenVAS)**

### 1. Outdated Windows Updates – **Medium Risk**
- **Description:** Several important Windows security updates are missing, increasing exposure to known exploits.  
- **Recommendation:** Apply all pending updates and enable automatic updates.

### 2. SMBv1 Enabled – **High Risk**
- **Description:** SMBv1 protocol is still enabled, which is vulnerable to multiple exploits such as EternalBlue.  
- **Recommendation:** Disable SMBv1 and use SMBv2/SMBv3.

### 3. Weak TLS Configuration – **Medium Risk**
- **Description:** The server supports weak TLS ciphers and older protocols (TLS 1.0 / 1.1).  
- **Recommendation:** Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher and disable weak ciphers.

### 4. Unnecessary Open Ports – **Low Risk**
- **Description:** Several unused ports are listening, increasing the system’s attack surface.  
- **Recommendation:** Close unused ports and restrict access via firewall rules.

The vulnerability assessment revealed several **medium and high-severity issues** related to:
- Weak SMB security settings (SMB signing not enforced, SMBv1 enabled)
- Use of untrusted/self-signed SSL certificates
- Weak TLS configurations
- Unnecessary open ports

By addressing these vulnerabilities — particularly disabling SMBv1, enforcing SMB signing, and using valid SSL certificates — the system’s resistance to common attack vectors can be significantly improved.  
The Nessus and OpenVAS results complemented each other, providing a more complete security overview.
